CIOs throughout the private and public sectors are combining what their organizations do well with new ideas about technology, learning and ecosystems. Gartner’s 2020 Symposium Keynote covers the strategies that, even in turmoil, create greater advantage.","1":"In order to win in volatile times, composability needs to be aimed at the goal of becoming antifragile.

This presentation examines the mechanisms behind industry disruption and shares mental models for a successful transformation so that enterprises can achieve greater agility and innovation.","10":"As organizations strive to become more agile during periods of rapid change, the need for a unified technology foundation is becoming paramount.

From the next generation of augmented user experiences beyond dashboards to the use of decision intelligence and X analytics, to finding new insights across streams of data and content, there is a rapid evolution in how and where analysis can be deployed. Understanding the business impact of these changes will allow organizations to resource optimize, accelerate change, drive innovation and transform society over the next three to five years. Data and analytics leaders must examine how to leverage these trends to identify “must-have” investments through the recovery.","17":"Digital Dragons are impacting the enterprise application market at an ever increasing pace.

CIOs must learn to tap this pool as a key resource in the digital business era.","56":"Pandemic recover and renew strategies come with uncertainty and require a high pace of change. The inertia of existing (legacy) applications can introduce impediments and delays. CIOs require an application modernization approach that provides agility and velocity where needed.

A trained ethnographer, Sinek is fascinated by the people and organizations that make the greatest and longest lasting impact in the world.
